# Workshop Site — Building Rules

These rules apply whenever building or editing pages in this workshop site.
Follow them exactly. Do not deviate without Joe's explicit instruction.

---

## Session Cards — Equal Height Rule

All cards on session index pages (`/session/[slug]/`) must be the same height. Always:
- Add `className="h-full"` to every `<Reveal>` wrapper around a card
- Add `flex flex-col h-full` to every card `<Link>` or locked `<div>`
- Add `flex-1` to the description `<p>` so it expands and pushes the CTA to the bottom

This rule applies to every card on every session detail page, locked or not.

---

## Audience

Absolute beginners. No coding experience. English-first at all times.

- Never show raw code for participants to copy and paste as-is if it requires expert knowledge to fill in correctly.
- Every technical action should be a plain-English instruction they give to Claude Code.
- Minimize manual steps. If Claude Code can do it, Claude Code should do it.
- Never use em dashes. Use "and," "then," or a period instead.

---

## Code Blocks — Editable Rule

Any `CodeBlock` that contains placeholder text the participant must fill in before copying
**must** use the `editable` prop:

```tsx
<CodeBlock editable code={`...`} />
```

Indicators that a block needs `editable={true}`:
- Contains text in `[BRACKETS]` (e.g., `[YOUR HEADLINE]`, `[YOUR RESOURCE URL]`)
- Contains placeholder values like `[YOUR NAME]`, `[PASTE KEY HERE]`
- Any field where a person-specific value must be substituted before use

The `editable` prop renders the block as a live textarea with an "Edit before copying"
badge in the header bar. This signals to participants they must customize before hitting Copy.

Blocks that do NOT need `editable`:
- Fixed terminal commands (`npm run dev`, `npx vercel --prod`)
- DNS record values (these are universal)
- Claude Code prompts with no placeholders

---

## Bonus Sections

Bonus sections must be visually distinct from the main guide — they should look like
an entirely separate, featured section, not just another step. Use the pink gradient
card treatment with a large heading (text-4xl or bigger).

---

## Links

Link to every external service mentioned. Never write a service name as plain text
if there is a URL to link to. Supabase, Vercel, Resend, Porkbun — all clickable.
Deep-link where possible (e.g., Supabase SQL Editor, Resend API Keys page).

---

## Claude Code Prompts

When writing Claude Code prompts for participants:
- Every session guide must start with a setup step titled **Claude Dangerously Skip Permissions**
- That first setup step must tell Claude Code users to start their session in Dangerously Skip Permissions before they begin the workshop
- Write them in plain English, not code
- Structure as clear numbered or bulleted instructions
- Include all context Claude needs (table names, field names, behavior on edge cases)
- Never require participants to understand what the prompt is doing technically
- Every participant prompt block must include the shared `Copy Codex Only` button for Codex members
- The Codex version must start with `codex --yolo`, then a blank line, then the Codex wording of the same prompt
- Use the shared `CodeBlock` component for prompts so the format stays consistent across all pages
- Prompt block filenames must include the word `prompt` so the Codex copy button appears automatically

---

## Supabase Keys

Supabase no longer uses `anon` and `service_role` keys. New projects use:

- **Publishable key** (`sb_publishable_...`) — replaces the old `anon` key
- **Secret key** (`sb_secret_...`) — replaces the old `service_role` key

When writing env variable names, use:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (not `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)

Never reference `anon key`, `service_role`, or the legacy variable names in guides.

---

## Giveaway Pages — Registry Rule

Every new giveaway page lives under `src/app/giveaways/<slug>/page.tsx`.

**When you create a new giveaway page, you must also add an entry to `src/lib/giveaways.ts`.**
That file is the single source of truth. The index at `/giveaways/` is generated from it automatically.

Each entry needs: `slug`, `title`, `description`, `icon`, `badge`, and `badgeVariant` (`'purple'` or `'pink'`).

Never add a giveaway page without registering it. Never register a slug without a matching page.

---

## Prep Pages

Use `session-3-prep.tsx` as the canonical template for all prep pages.
Interactive checkboxes, progress bar, TOC with shared state — all required.

---

## Templates — Mandatory

Every new workshop page must be built from an existing template in `src/templates/`.
Never start a page from scratch. Copy the closest template and fill in the markers.

- **Session guides** — use `src/templates/session-guide-template.tsx`
- **Prep pages** — use `src/content/session-3-prep.tsx` as canonical reference

If a page type has no template yet, create one in `src/templates/` first, then build the page from it.
